        "The previous attempt to run the analysis workflow failed because the model 'gemini-1.5-flash' was not found or not supported for `generateContent` despite being 'successfully loaded' in an earlier step. This indicates that the initial model loading logic was not robust enough to ensure the chosen model is truly functional for content generation. To fix this, I will update the LLM initialization to explicitly select 'models/gemini-2.5-flash' (as identified in the `available_generative_models` from the kernel state and requested in the original task as 'Gemini 2.5 Flash'). If 'models/gemini-2.5-flash' is not available for content generation, it will fall back to the first model returned by `gen.list_models()` that supports `generateContent`, ensuring a functional model is always loaded.\n",
