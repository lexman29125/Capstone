This indicates that the initial model loading logic was not robust enough to ensure the chosen model is truly functional for content generation. To fix this, I will update the LLM initialization to explicitly select 'models/gemini-2.5-flash' (as identified in the `available_generative_models` from the kernel state and requested in the original task as 'Gemini 2.5 Flash'). If 'models/gemini-2.5-flash' is not available for content generation, it will fall back to the first model returned by `gen.list_models()` that supports `generateContent`, ensuring a functional model is always loaded.\n",

        "*   Implementing user interaction elements such as job URL input and resume upload with robust validation features.\n",
        "*   Adapting the `run_analysis_workflow` function to display its output using various Streamlit components for a dynamic user experience.\n",
        "*   Providing clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the Streamlit application from the command line.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The Streamlit application's core UI, including page configuration, title, and a sidebar for user inputs, was successfully established.\n",
        "*   User input fields for job description URLs and PDF resume uploads were implemented with validation, providing feedback using `st.sidebar.error`, `st.warning`, and `st.success` messages.\n",
        "*   The AI agent workflow, including `CoordinatorAgent` and its tools, was successfully integrated and re-defined within the Streamlit context to handle Google Generative AI model setup and API key management.\n",
        "*   The asynchronous `root_agent.run_live` function was adapted to display its streaming output dynamically using Streamlit components like `st.spinner`, `st.progress`, `st.text` for status updates, and `st.markdown` for the final report.\n",
        "*   Comprehensive instructions for running the Streamlit application were generated, detailing file creation (`app.py`), code transfer, dependency installation (`pip install streamlit PyPDF2 beautifulsoup4 requests google-generativeai nest-asyncio`), Google API Key environment variable setup, and execution commands (`streamlit run app.py`).\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The Streamlit application is functionally complete and ready for deployment, offering a user-friendly interface for the AI-powered resume and job description analysis.\n",
        "*   While the instructions for running the application were eventually generated correctly, recurring `SyntaxError` messages in the initial attempts highlight a need to improve the robustness of the system's markdown generation process to prevent repetitive retries.\n"

        "### Q&A\n",
        "The changes made to integrate the OpenAI LLM involve:\n",
        "1.  **Installation of the OpenAI library:** The `openai` Python library was installed using `!pip install openai`.\n",
        "2.  **OpenAI Client Configuration:** An `OpenAI` client was initialized, requiring an `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be provided (either from an environment variable or user input). The `gpt-4o-mini` model was chosen for the analysis.\n",
        "3.  **LLM Function Integration:** The `analyze_skills_and_gaps` function was refactored to use the `openai_client.chat.completions.create` method. It now employs a `system_prompt` to define the LLM's role as an HR analyst and a `user_prompt` containing the resume and job description, explicitly requesting output in a JSON format.\n",
        "4.  **Agent and Tool Updates:** The `analysis_tool` was updated to call the new `analyze_resume_job_description_full` function (which wraps the LLM call), and the `candidate_agent` was re-instantiated with this new tool. The `CoordinatorAgent` was also redefined to orchestrate the workflow using these updated components.\n",
        "\n",
        "The successful operation was confirmed by running the `run_analysis_workflow` function with dummy resume and job description texts. After initial debugging of empty input texts, the workflow successfully invoked the OpenAI LLM, which produced a comprehensive and structured JSON report containing candidate skills, required job skills, matched skills, missing skills, additional skills, and an overall fit summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The OpenAI Python library was successfully installed after correcting a `SyntaxError` by adding the necessary `!` prefix to the `pip install` command for shell execution within the notebook environment.\n",
        "*   The OpenAI client was successfully configured and initialized, leveraging the `gpt-4o-mini` model and correctly handling the `OPENAI_API_KEY` through environment variables or user input.\n",
        "*   The core analysis logic in the `analyze_skills_and_gaps` function was replaced to utilize the OpenAI LLM, with explicit instructions for JSON output format, ensuring structured results.\n",
        "*   The agent architecture, including the `analysis_tool`, `candidate_agent`, and `CoordinatorAgent`, was successfully updated to integrate and orchestrate the new OpenAI LLM-based analysis.\n",
        "*   The end-to-end workflow was validated by processing dummy resume and job description texts, resulting in a detailed JSON analysis report from the OpenAI LLM. This report included a list of `candidate_skills`, `required_job_skills`, `matched_skills`, `missing_skills`, and `additional_skills`, along with an `overall_fit_summary`.\n",
